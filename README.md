# Theater Seating Management System

## Project Description
This Java-based **Theater Seating Management System** provides an efficient and structured way to manage seating arrangements in a theater. The system ensures smooth seat allocation, optimizes space utilization, and enhances the user experience by implementing an intuitive approach to seat classification, spectator assignments, and validation mechanisms.

## Features
- **Advanced Seat Management:** Each seat is uniquely identified and comes with attributes like availability, seat type, and special gifts, making it adaptable for different theater settings.
- **Dynamic Seat Categorization:** Implements an enum-based classification (`OT`, `IT`, `MT`) for clear differentiation and structured seating.
- **Optimized Spectator Allocation:** Ensures spectators are assigned the best available seats while maintaining logical and structured seating arrangements.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** Designed using object-oriented principles, making the system highly scalable and easy to maintain.
- **Comprehensive JUnit Testing:** Implements a robust test suite to validate the integrity and correctness of the seating management system, ensuring it meets industry standards.
